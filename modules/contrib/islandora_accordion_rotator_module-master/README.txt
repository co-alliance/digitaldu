#### SUMMARY
 This module is an adaptation of the 'Dynamic Accordion Banner Rotator' created by codecanyon.

#### REQUIREMENTS
 Instead of using static images, this module uses datastreams such as large image or image datastreams. 
 Islandora module is required, as well as tuque to interact with fedora.

#### INSTALLATION
 Install as any other module, and enable the block and add it to content (or any other area).

#### CONFIGURATION
 By default, there is a sample image and description. To configure additional content, gather
 a group of pids and enter them as a comma seperated list in the modules configuration page. After
 saving your new configuration, you will need to clear all cache in drupal before they will be displayed
 in the accordion.
